 Installing HT
===============

(1)
    a. (Only if you're NOT using a tarball / release:)

            ./autogen.sh

       (This will generate the configure scripts)

    b. To configure: This creates the development (debug) version of HT (-g -O0):

            ./configure --disable-release

    c. If you want a final (release) version (-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer) do the 
       following instead:

            ./configure --enable-release

    d. if you want to build with profiling information (-pg -g) add '--enable-profiling'

    e. for installing in /usr (instead /usr/local) add '--prefix=/usr'

(2) (Only if you're NOT using a tarball / release:)

        make; make htdoc.h
        (because of a broken dependency)

(3) compile and link HT:

        make

(4) (optionally) install HT:

        make install

(5) run HT:

        ht or ./ht

Note: The package 'tex4ht' comes with a program called /usr/bin/ht which
      conflicts with this program's name...
      In order to use both programs properly you should rename one of them.
      (for example: mv /usr/local/bin/ht /usr/local/bin/ht.alt)
